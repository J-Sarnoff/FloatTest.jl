##### tests: no double rounding, rounds without extra precison, chip/software fma works

Just copy the raw file and paste it into your REPL

There are only three tests, and they take much less time than does pasting.

If they pass you will see

*The numerics tested work properly.*

If any test does not pass, that information is shown.  
And it would be generally useful to know the test that failed and versioninfo().

I want to rely on capabilities that are very widely shared.
